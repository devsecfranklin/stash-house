In this project we consider the issue of a "dirty" local development
environment, and precisely what to do about it. Using freely available
Open Source tools and a few easy to remember patterns we can work in a
much more efficient and secure manner.

* First we look at how to set up a workable solution for storing credentials.
* Next we do some local search and cleanup to get our systems in order.
* Finally, we will see how we can still easily use these credentials, though
  they remain encrypted at rest and in transit to our "vault" from now on.
