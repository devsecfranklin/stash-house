- NOTE: This section of the demo does contain inert keys and credentials.
  - These may trigger alerts in your build pipeline
  - Do NOT store your credentials in revision control. NO. BAD.
- Use the `dirs.txt` and `files.txt` files to direct the tool on where to look.
- This tool is intentionally limited in scope and capabillities.
  - We are not trying to create a script kiddie scanning tool.
